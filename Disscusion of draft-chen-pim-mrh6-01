Question 1. What is the meaning of "B flag"?
It is easy to understand what has been enhanced from figure 3 to figure 4. But it is hard to get the meaning of the encapsulation
showed in figure 5, which is significantly compressed and the structure of segment list can hardly be recognized any more. 
[HC]: Slides 6 and 7 presented in IETF 113 show some details about B flag. 
For example: In Page 7, it is mentioned that 
"The B flag added for a link indicates whether the link bits+ are used to represent the link numbers and other link related 
information such as whether links' remote end nodes (i.e., next hops) are leaves. "
Could you please give more clear difinition of "link bits+ " and also more explanation for "P field" and "S-Bits"?
[HC]: Page 8 of the draft contains the definitions of these fields. Can you check if they are enough?

[XS]:Thanks Huaimo, after playing back the presentation in IETF 113, I understand the idea better.
If I understand this right, "link bits+" represents the outgoing port of the penultimate hop and the link connected the leaf will be set to 1, which 
could save the "Link number" field for the leaves.  This is an efficient method to encode the multicast tree, which could save 
the packet encapsulation overhead of the segment for the leaf nodes by introducing local bitstring. Similar idea could also be found 
in section 6 of draft-geng-msr6-rlb-segment (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-geng-msr6-rlb-segment/), the difference is that 
draft-geng-msr6-rlb-segment defines a new type of SID for local bitstring and the whole tree is encoded by hierarchical segment list. 
Here are 2 further questions based on this:
1. Will introducing link number for the non-penultimate hop further save the overhead, compared to whole bitstring encoding?
2. If only introducing local bistring for the penultimate hop, will there be any problem for alighment of each segment?
